# Wallit Technical Documentation

> How many software developers does it take to change a lightbulb?  None! That's a hardware problem!

Hey there! Welcome to our developer docs.  Trust us, we know that these things can get a little long winded and dry from
time to time.  It's our intent to make this as painless as possible - like a root canal or a broken bone. Not bad at all!

Seriously though, whether you've been tasked to implement Wallit into your platform or you're just doing an audit to 
see how easy (or hard?) it is to use us, we're glad you're here.  We only ask for **one favor**: if you see a bug in the 
documentation, create a ticket, send a pull request, or at the very least, angrily tweet at us [(@mywallit)](https://twitter.com/mywallit).

So, let's get started.

## Overview

We're assuming you already know a little bit about how Wallit works or what it does.  If not, just take a quick scroll
through the [wallit.io](https://wallit.io) website - and then come back here. This documentation will describe a few 
things: how to use the API's to automate the integration, how to create a paywall or access control system on your 
web platform, and how to integrate external subscription services.  

Have you ever had a meeting about an upcoming meeting? Then this should seem familiar: let us document what we're going to document:

**[Overview of Concepts]({{site.baseurl}}/overview-of-concepts)** What API to use & why, how things generally work, and where to go (hey now!) to get your task done

**[Overview of User Interfaces]({{site.baseurl}}/overview-of-user-interfaces)** An explanation of the various user interfaces to Wallit

**[Example and Common Scenarios]({{site.baseurl}}/common-scenarios)** Let's face it - most docs are **tldr;** - so scan this list first to see if we've already implemented your scenario

**[Detailed API Documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/api)** Here we get into how to make API calls, what endpoints are, and the objects you can send/expect

Clear as mud? Let's get started.

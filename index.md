# Wallit on GitHub

Since you're on GitHub, you're probably a programmer or someone with IT knowledge. If your first language isn't nerd, visit [our corporate site](https://wallit.io) to learn more about Wallit, the subscription management solution.

This site holds the documentation and code that Wallit has open-sourced for your integrations. First thing's first, make sure you have a merchant account with Wallit. You're going to need your API keys for any of the integrations. Next, choose if you're going to integrate with our software directly using Javascript, PHP, or any other language, or if you're going to use one of the plugins. If you want to use the plugins, you can download them directly from GitHub.
